## Papers using CoFESWave

*There are supplementary materials for three papers the repository. For easy reference we refer to the three series of papers as the Application, Method, and Forecasting Paper, respectively.*

### **Application Paper**
This paper is primarily written to communicate the usage of wavelet techniques for non-stationary time seires in Finance and Economics
Reference: Time-varying wavelet-based applications for evaluating the Water-Energy Nexus

### **Methods Paper**
In this paper we develop a novel Wavelet thresholding technique using the $$L_2E$$ developed by our co-author David W. Scott. This method was primarily developed to address issues that are not efficiently addressed by non-stationary time-series tools

### **Forecasting Paper**
This paper uses the extra parameters extracted using the $$WaveL_2E$$ tresholding techniques to forecast the non-stationary time series.
Reference: Advanced volatility forecasting after time-series denoising using novel hybrid wavelet-$$L_2E$$ ($$WaveL_2E$$) thresholding method
