# CoFESWave Research
*This repository is primarily for storing the Supplementary Materials in papers using the CoFESWave R Package.* 
    
## Papers using CoFESWave

*There are supplementary materials for three papers the repository. For easy reference we refer to the three series of papers as the Application, Method, and Forecasting Paper, respectively.*

### **Application Paper**
This paper is primarily written to communicate the usage of wavelet techniques for non-stationary time series in Finance and Economics. We specifically apply the techniques to the complex behaviors in the Water-Energy Nexus. 

**Reference: [Time-varying wavelet-based applications for evaluating the Water-Energy Nexus](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3123858)**

### **Methods Paper**
In this paper we develop a novel Wavelet thresholding technique using the L<sub>2</sub>E developed by our co-author David W. Scott. This method was primarily developed to address issues that are not efficiently addressed by non-stationary time-series tools.

### **Forecasting Paper**
This paper uses the extra parameters extracted using the WaveL<sub>2</sub>E tresholding techniques to forecast the non-stationary time series.

**Reference: [Advanced forecasting after time-series denoising using novel hybrid wavelet-L<sub>2</sub>E (WaveL<sub>2</sub>E) thresholding method]()**
